        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 15px;" align="justify">At a young age, I began my journey crafting essays, stories, and poems. Writing had always been my favorite form of art. Simultaneously, my exposure to marketing, advertising, and sales was initiated due to our family's ownership of a seasonal fireworks retail selling business. Over the course of more than ten years, I've gained substantial experience in all of these fields.
            As I entered adulthood, it became clear to me that my aim in life is to empower brands with my words.</p>
